## Contributing

Unity 5 was used to develop this project.
In order to open project in Unity you must have Blender installed. Open folder `Unity Project` in Unity. 
Place new .blend files inside `Unity project\Assets\3D`. Do not use `3D stuff` folder, 
these files should be migrated into `Assets\3D`.
